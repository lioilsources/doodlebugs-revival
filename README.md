- speed control: down => speed up, up => speed down

7/11/2020
- movement restriction
- space: speed = 0
- left, right: delayed flip, rotation = 0
- ground: explosion
- speed incerementation on fall down

4/11/2020
- fix rotation on reverse direction
- GameObject.SendMessage() instead of sharing  variables between scripts or even have some globals

03/11/2020
- playground by left and right border collider triggers show off bug in rotation code

02/11/2020
- explosion animation
- ground and cloud explosion on trigger
- (n) git repo init

- plane asset
- plane movement: `rb.velocity = rb.transform.right * speed;`
- cloud colision rotation: `rb.transform.localRotation *= Quaternion.Euler(0, 180, 0);`
