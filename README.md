- PlayerController to control movement of Plane

- GallacticKittens deep dive
- Scripts
-- PlayerShipController.cs: input handling for movement if IsOwner
-- PlayerShipMovement.cs: Update if IsOwner; on movement change call ServerRPC -> ClientRPC to propagate sprite change
-- PlayerShipShootBullet.cs: input handling for shooting if IsOwner; SpawnNewNetworkObject (Bullet Prefab) + attach character data to BulletController
-- CharacterDataSO.cs: ScriptableObject, game data, character variations
- Prefabs
-- PlayerShipBase: ClientNetworkTransform (controllable on client)
-- Bullet: NetworkObject
-- shield: IDamagable (Hit), OnTriggerEnter2D act on Server, 2x NetworkBehaviour scripts NetworkObject on Parent node

- (doc) https://docs-multiplayer.unity3d.com/netcode/current/basics/object-spawning/
- NetworkManager behaviour
- automatic Spawning Player Prefab (Prefab with NetworkObject/NetworkBehaviour component added)
- player NetworkPrefab needs to be added in Network Prefab Lists list
-- host Instantiate local GameObject, on client join it Spawn this object on client with Server ownership (server authority) and sync transform.position
-- client join server/host and ask server to Instantiate GameObject on host and Spawn on client with Client ownership (client authority)
- destroying player
- id: NetworkObject.NetworkObjectId
-- host Destroy player, Instantiate player, Spawn player
-- clients call ServerRpc to Destroy client player, Instantiate player NetworkPrewab, Spawn it with client authority

9/9/2023
- make game playable
- destroy plane on collision
- respawn plane
- world boundaries
- dedicated server run on dedicated machine

4/9/2023
- spawning Birds
- (error) Only the owner can invoke a ServerRpc that requires ownership!
- (quiz) you can spawn Bird on client but you can move (A,S) only on host

3/9/2023
- Networking summary:
-- NetworkManager - Player Prefab to spawn Plane on Host or on Client on (0,0) position
-- NetworkManager - Network Prefabs Lists to hol all Network Object Prefab Assets
-- NetworkManager.Singleton.StartHost() - create host instance
-- NetworkManager.Singleton.StartClient() - join client instance into existing host
-- NetworkObject - to extend from NewtworkBehaviour
-- NetworkObject.IsOwner - to work only with object spawn on the right client
-- NetworkObject.OwnerClientId - unique network id
-- annotation [ServerRpc] - triggered on both host/client; executed on host
-- annotation [ClientRpc] - triggered on host; executed on all clients
-- ClientNetworkTransform - server authoritative false
- add Bullet.RigidBody2D Gravity Scale 0->2; if disable NetworkRigidBody2D gravity is also there
- (issue) there is de-sync with Bullet + Cloud collision; sometime Bullet explode on one screen but not on other

2/9/2023
- (fix) Plane flies in right direction on startup (x=0, y=0)
- (update) Bird starting position changed to (x=-19, y=1) to start on left border
- (update) Plane speed from 5 to 2 to slower movement for debuging purposes
- shooting logic use AddForce feature
- ServerRPC call to broadcast ClientRPC to instantiate local Bullet + AddForce localy on Host & Clients
- (?) it is confusing to me why in that case I'm not able to remove all that Bullet/Shooting NetworkBehaviour logic (client is not able to connect to host).

- (t) GameDevHQ - How to Calculate Angles in Unity - A Unity Math Tutorial
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-Ho5hF2Yww
- direction
```
// calculate direction = destination - source
Vector3 direction = enemy.position - transform.position
```
- angle
``` 
// calculate the angle using the inverse tangent method
// Unity eagle system is clockwise (0 on top) oriented; shifted -90 from regular
float angle = Mathf.Atan2(direction.y, direction.x) * Mathf.Rad2Deg - 90;
// #1 define the rotation along a specific axis using angle
Quaterion angleAxis = Quaterion.AngleAxis(angle, Vector3.forward);
// slerp from our current rotation to the new specific rotation
transform.rotation = Quaterion.Slerp(transform.rotation, angleAxis, Time.deltaTime * 50);
// or
// #2 take our current euler angles and we just add our new angle to it
transform.eulerAngles = Vector3.forward * angle
```
- mouse mapping (mouse pointer is enemy now)
```
// camera is placed Z = -10
Vector3 direction = Camera.main.ScreenToWorldPoint(new Vector3(Input.mousePosition.x, Input.mousePosition.y, 10)) - transform.position
```
- debug commands
```
Debug.DrawRay(transform.position, direction, Color.green);
Debug.Log("Angle: " + angle);
```
